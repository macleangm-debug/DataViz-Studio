<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested to pull the codebase from the GitHub repository  to begin work.

The initial request was to see the PDF Export layout. After seeing the basic layout, the user requested a complete redesign to a more professional, infographic style based on a provided image. This evolved into a feature-rich report builder with the following requirements:
- The report header should be customizable by the user.
- Add the DataViz Studio logo to the footer.
- The layout should be improved, with charts inside cards.
- The system should start with an auto-layout for charts, but allow the user to drag, drop, and resize them.
- The report should include editable sections for Introduction, Methodology, and Conclusions.
- The system should provide preset color themes and allow for custom color choices.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack data visualization application. The backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) have been successfully set up and are running. The user authentication flow has been debugged and is functional.

A significant amount of work has been done to overhaul the backend PDF generation service. The original basic PDF export has been replaced with a sophisticated, infographic-style report generator using . This new backend functionality supports customizable themes, dynamic text sections (intro, conclusions), a two-column card-based layout for charts, and the company logo in the footer.

The agent was in the process of building the corresponding frontend UI for this feature—a Report Builder page—before the session ended.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was creating the new Report Builder page on the frontend (). This page is intended to provide a user interface for the newly created backend PDF generation features, including drag-and-drop and resize functionality for report components. The agent had created the file, added its route in , added a link in the , and was in the middle of writing the component's code when the session was terminated due to a memory limit error.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs or issues aside from the main task in progress.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete the Report Builder Frontend UI (P0)**
    - **Where to resume:** The agent must resume work on the file . The file is currently incomplete and was the last thing being worked on before a pod crash. The next agent needs to review the file, fix any syntax or import errors, and complete the implementation.
    - **What will be achieved with this?** This will create the user-facing interface for the powerful PDF reporting engine. Users will be able to visually build and customize their reports by dragging, dropping, and resizing charts and other elements. They will also be able to edit text sections and select themes.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    - **Blocked on something:** No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **P0: End-to-End Testing of the Report Builder:** After the UI is complete, perform a full test of the flow:
        1.  Use the Report Builder UI to create a custom report layout (arranging charts, editing text).
        2.  Trigger the PDF export.
        3.  Verify the generated PDF matches the custom layout, theme, and content from the UI.
    - **P1: Implement Custom Color Picker:** The user requested both preset themes and custom color options. The presets are implemented in the backend; the UI for selecting them and a custom color picker still needs to be built on the frontend.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - No future tasks have been defined by the user yet.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Project Setup:** Cloned the repository, installed all dependencies, and successfully started the backend and frontend services.
- **Authentication Fix:** Debugged and resolved a user login failure by correcting a field mismatch ( vs. ) in the user creation and authentication logic.
- **Backend PDF Redesign:** Completely rewrote the PDF export functionality in .
    - Implemented a professional, infographic-style layout based on a user-provided image.
    - Added support for customizable report titles, subtitles, and company names.
    - Integrated the DataViz Studio logo into the report footer.
    - Created multiple color themes (e.g., blue_coral, purple_teal) and a better two-column, card-based layout for charts.
    - Added dynamic, user-editable sections for Introduction, Methodology, and Conclusions.
- **Frontend Scaffolding:** Began creating the Report Builder UI by:
    - Creating the new page component file: .
    - Adding the required route in .
    - Adding a navigation link in the .

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python,  for server-side PDF generation.
- **Frontend:** React,  and  for drag and drop,  for component resizing.
- **Database:** MongoDB for user authentication.

**key DB schema**
- **users**: 

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes to the core technologies. New libraries were introduced to support requested features:
    - **Backend:**  (already present, but usage was heavily modified).
    - **Frontend:** , ,  (added via yarn add v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command.).

**All files of reference**
- **/app/backend/server.py**: Significantly updated. The  endpoint logic was completely replaced to support the new infographic-style PDF generation.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/ReportBuilderPage.js**: A new, partially completed file that is the primary focus for the next session.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Modified to add the route for the .
- **/app/frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.js**: Modified to add a navigation link to the .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The  file has grown quite large and contains logic for authentication, data sources, and now complex PDF reporting. For long-term maintainability, it could be beneficial to split the routes and logic into separate modules (e.g., , ), but this is not an active user request.

**key api endpoints**
- : User authentication.
- : Generates a customized PDF report. The request body now accepts a comprehensive JSON object specifying the title, theme, layout, and content for various sections.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- You are picking up after a pod crash caused by a memory limit exception. The crash occurred while the agent was actively writing code in . Your immediate task is to repair and complete this file.
- The backend functionality for the advanced PDF export is **already complete**. Do not modify the backend unless a bug is found during frontend integration.
- The goal for the frontend is to build a UI that allows users to:
    1.  Drag, drop, and resize report elements.
    2.  Input custom text for the Intro, Methodology, and Conclusions sections.
    3.  Select a color theme.
- The completed UI must send the correct JSON payload to the  endpoint to generate the final report.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
- No persistent documents were created.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1. **User:** PRoceed howver the PDF is not well aligned maybe we can keep the graphs in the cards. With the drag and drop can the user be able to re-size them?
   - **Summary:** User approved proceeding with the Report Builder UI, requested better PDF alignment using cards (which was implemented), and asked for resize functionality (which was planned). **Status: In Progress.**
2. **User:** On the footer we need to have the DataViz Studio Logo. And also imlpement better layout... Or should this arrangement be done by the user?
   - **Summary:** User requested the logo in the footer and opened the discussion on report layout customization. **Status: Implemented & Clarified.**
